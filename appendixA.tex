\section{\MakeUppercase{There Be Math in Them There Hills}}

In this appendix we further explain the line detection technique introduced in Section~\ref{ch3:detection}. Equations show we can match the filters.

\begin{equation}
P(F,T) = \frac{F}{F_o} - \int_{T_D}^{0}{\frac{T}{T_D}dT}
\end{equation}

where $P$ is the probability of me giving a Fuck at a given point in time, $F$ is the number of Fucks I currently have, $F_o$ is the total number of Fucks available, $T$ is the current time remaining until a deadline, for a given total given to complete the task, $T_D$.

Did you know that this won't show up as listed in the table of contents, in accordance with NMSU thesis policy? Exciting.

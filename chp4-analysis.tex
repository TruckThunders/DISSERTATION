\section{\MakeUppercase{Analysis of Absorption Properties}}
\label{ch4}

This is how we look at squiggles and tell you they mean something.

\subsection{Equivalent Width Regions}
\label{ch4:regions}

We put windows on things.

\subsection{Calculating Redshifts and Velocities}
\label{ch4:redshift}

Something something optical depth weighted medians.

\subsection{Equivalent Widths and Kinematic Spreads}
\label{ch4:ew}

Integrate the things and do something with tau.

\subsection{Column Densities}
\label{ch4:column}

AOD stuff here.

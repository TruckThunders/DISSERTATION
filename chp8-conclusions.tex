WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?!

\subsection{{\MgII}}
\label{ch8:MgII}

Long song and dance about how MgII is so great and all.

\subsubsection{Strong Absorbers}
\label{ch8:MgIIstrong}

Talk about all the properties of strong absorbers.

\subsubsection{Weak Absorbers}
\label{ch8:MgIIweak}

Talk about all the properties of weak absorbers.

\subsubsection{Kinematics}
\label{ch8:MgIIkinematics}

Talk about kinematic properties of MgII absorbers.

\subsection{{\CIV}}
